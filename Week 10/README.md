# Weeks 10 & 11: Honeypot
Time spent: 10 hours

A honeypot is a decoy application, server, or other networked resource that intentionally exposes insecure features which, when exploited by an attacker, will reveal information about the methods, tools, and possibly even the identity of that attacker. 


    Which Honeypot(s) were deployed:
    -Dionaea
    -Cowrie
    Any issues you encountered:
    Authentication issues can occur if more than one google cloud console is open. In order to avoid this issue multiple accounts or                   
    projects should not be open at the same time.
